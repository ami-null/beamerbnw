# beamerbnw

 Minimal Beamer template

## Usage

- `\usepackage[sec=page]{beamerbnw}` for section pages (`page` is the default and can be ommited)

- `\usepackage[sec=footer]{beamerbnw}` for section name in footer

### Blocks

Apart from Beamer's built-in `block` environment, this template also defines a `tcblock` environment using the `tcolorbox` package, and two commands `fblock` and `fblocknt` using the `\framebox` and `\parbox` commands, for creating blocks (check the demo PDF for usage).
